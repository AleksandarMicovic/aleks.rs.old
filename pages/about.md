## Me

If you're looking for my CV, you can find it [here](/static/resume.pdf).

My name is Aleksandar Micovic, and this is my little corner of the Internet. I have a degree in Computer Science from the University of Toronto, and I also happen to live in said city as well. I spend a lot of my spare time coding, and consistently dreaming about monads and burritos. I have not spoken to a psychologist yet.

This page is a catch-all for all minutiae and miscellanea. Mostly stuff that doesn't fit into any other category, but stuff I still want to share.
