  <h1>About</h1>

  <h2>Me</h2>
  <p>If you're looking for my CV, you can find it <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
  <p>My name is Aleksandar Micovic, and this is my little corner of the Internet. I have a degree in Computer Science from the University of Toronto, and I also happen to live in said city as well. Currently, I'm working as a software developer for Good World Games. I spend a lot of my spare time coding, and consistently dreaming about monads and burritos. I have not spoken to a psychologist yet. </p>
  <p>This page is a catch-all for all minutia and miscellaneous things. Mostly stuff that doesn't fit into any other category, but stuff I still want to share.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
