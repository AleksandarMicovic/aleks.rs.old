  <h2>Hello!</h2>
  <p>My name is Aleksandar Micovic, and this is my little corner of the Internet. I have a degree in Computer Science from the University of Toronto, and I also happen to live here as well. I spend a lot of my spare time coding, and consistently dreaming about monads and burritos. I have not spoken to a psychologist yet. Apart from code, I enjoy cooking and writing (read: ranting).
